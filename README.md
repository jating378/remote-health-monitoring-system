# remote health monitoring system
 his repository contains the implementation of a Remote Health Monitoring System (RHMS) prototype. The project focuses on real-time monitoring of patient vitals using synthetic data, machine learning algorithms, and an API-based architecture. Key features include:  Dynamic Threshold Adjustments: Automatically adapt thresholds based on patient data patterns. Anomaly Detection: Machine learning models for identifying critical health events. Real-Time Alerts: Instant notifications for abnormal vital readings. Data Visualization: A user-friendly dashboard displaying live health metrics and trends. This system aims to address key challenges in remote healthcare, such as reducing false-positive alerts, enhancing scalability, and improving early intervention capabilities. The project is aligned with ethical guidelines (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and utilizes only synthetic data for testing.
